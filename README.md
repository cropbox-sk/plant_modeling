This site contains lab notebooks for SEFS 508: Plant Modeling course at the University of Washington. These notebooks introduce fundamental principles and techniques useful for process-based plant and crop modeling. We use Cropbox (https://github.com/cropbox) written in Julia as the primary tool to teach this course. Cropbox is a crop modeling framework developed at the University of Washington.
